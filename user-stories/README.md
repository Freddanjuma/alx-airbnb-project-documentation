# 🧩 User Stories – ALX Airbnb Project

This document translates the **use case diagram** interactions into **user stories** to describe how different actors (Guest, Host, Admin, and Payment System) interact with the system.

Each story follows the format:

> As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that [I can achieve a goal].

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this section is to clearly outline the system’s intended behavior from the **user’s perspective**.  
These stories will serve as a foundation for feature development, testing, and validation.

---

## 🧍 Actors

- **Guest (User):** Browses, registers, books properties, and makes payments.
- **Host:** Lists and manages properties.
- **Admin:** Manages users, reviews listings, and oversees the system.
- **Payment System (External):** Handles secure payment processing.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Review user stories and align them with functional requirements.
2. Translate stories into **system requirements** and **API endpoints**.
3. Implement test cases to validate each story in later project stages.
